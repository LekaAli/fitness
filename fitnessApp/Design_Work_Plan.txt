Description:
------------

We want to come up with page design for the web application that we are currently working on. A lot of work has been done with regard to the back-end and nothing has been done with regard to its front-end, thus why we need to start designing its pages.

Brief Overview of the Application:
----------------------------------

- We have a group of Service Providers
- They provide service(s) to Service Seeker(s)/Recipient(s)
- Service Provider(s) can only provide their service(s) at a given Institution(s)
- Instiitution(s) can be Hospital(s),Clinic(s),School(s),Fitness Centre(s) and General Practioner(s)
- A Service Provider must be assigned to a given Institution(s) in order for them to provide their service(s) at that particular Institution(s)
- Service Seeker(s) request services from a given Service Provider assigned to an Institution given the following:
1. The Service Provider is not fully booked.
2. They(Service Seeker(s)) reside in a location where the Institution is located.
3. The Service Provider is available.

TODO:
Use bootstrap to design web pages for the following three(3) entities:

1. Service Provide
2. Service Seeker
3. Institution

N.B: 
- For each of the above three(3) entities we would want to be able to create,update and search an entity.
- The design should also be both mobile and desktop friendly.
